#### Introduction

This project demonstrates how JavaScript can be used as a helping hand behind the scenes to address issues and improve code. It is also a glimpse into how JavaScript is used to progressively enhance websites to introduce advanced features only when they are supported.

In this project, we have loops within loops. We're using an object, we're using attributes, and we're using other features to work with the data we have. Now of course this particular example is kind of contrived. I could solve the same problem by just putting my response images markup directly into index.html. However, if you think of a larger project, say a content management system, or maybe a legacy project that has a ton of images on a ton of pages, it would be a lot of work to go in and rewrite all the html.  So then a helper function like the one in script.js file might be a better option. That said there are better JavaScript solutions for generating responsive images markup available on the web. This example was created to show you how the logic of such a function would work and how we can use JavaScript to grab information from a document, do something really complicated to it, return it back into the document, and get a great effect in the web browser.

The practice was only did in JS/script.js file, other files were premade by the lecturer himself.
